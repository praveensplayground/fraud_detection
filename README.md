# Fraud Detection through Machine Learning

This is a repository on fraud detection through supervised machine learning method. It is a heavily imbalanced dataset and I have used python to clean data, visualize data, treat data imbalances, and run machine learning models and compare results. 

The jupyter notebook is arranged in a readable fashion which is divided into 6 parts:

1. Introduction
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Visualization
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Selection
6. Modelling
7. Results and discussion

I run 4 models ranging from simple models to more advanced models and select a statistical model based on the metrics of interest.
