# Fraud Detection through Machine Learning

This is a repository on fraud detection through supervised machine learning method. I use a dataset of credit card fraud in the United States. It is a heavily imbalanced with frauds occuring in only 1% of the time. I have used python to clean data, visualize data, treat data imbalances, feature engineering and run machine learning models and compare results. 

The jupyter notebook is arranged in a readable fashion which is divided into 6 parts:

1. Introduction
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Visualization
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Selection
6. Modelling
7. Results and discussion

I run 4 models ranging from simple models to more advanced models and select a statistical model based on the metrics of interest. The feature importance suggest that the superior accuracies owe primarily to the intelligent feature engineering that is done in the notebook.
